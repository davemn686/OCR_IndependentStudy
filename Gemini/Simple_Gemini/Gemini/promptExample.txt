The Midnight Visitor

It was nearly midnight when Sarah heard a faint knock on the door. The sound was so soft that she wondered if she had imagined it. She stood in her cozy living room, the crackling fireplace casting a warm glow across the walls. Outside, the wind howled, and the trees swayed violently in the storm.

Curiosity got the best of her. Wrapping a blanket around her shoulders, she tiptoed toward the door. Her hand hesitated on the doorknob. Who would be visiting her so late at night, especially in this weather?

After taking a deep breath, she slowly opened the door. At first, she saw nothing but the dark, stormy night. Then, her eyes adjusted, and she noticed a small figure standing in the rain—a little boy, no more than seven years old, soaked to the bone.

"Can I help you?" Sarah asked, her voice soft but puzzled.

The boy looked up at her with wide, sad eyes. "I’m lost," he said, his voice barely above a whisper. "Can I stay here for a while?"

Sarah felt her heart squeeze. There was something strange about the boy—his clothes looked old-fashioned, like they belonged to another time. But she couldn’t just leave him out there. She invited him inside, offered him a towel, and sat him by the fire.

"Where are your parents?" she asked gently.

The boy looked at the flames, not answering for a moment. Then he whispered, "I’ve been looking for them... for a long time."

Something about the way he said it sent a chill down Sarah’s spine. She looked closely at the boy. His skin was pale, almost translucent, and his wet hair clung to his forehead. But there was no shivering, no trembling—just stillness.

"How long have you been lost?" she asked, her voice trembling slightly.

The boy turned to her, his eyes locking onto hers. "A long, long time. Since before you were born."

The fire flickered, casting strange shadows on the walls. Sarah’s breath caught in her throat. She looked at the boy again, but this time, he seemed to fade, becoming part of the shadows around him.

Then, just as quickly as he had appeared, the boy was gone, leaving only a damp towel on the floor and the lingering scent of rain in the air.

Sarah stood there, her heart racing, unsure of what she had just experienced. Was it real? Or just a figment of her imagination, conjured by the stormy night?

But as she looked out into the dark, a soft voice echoed in her mind: "Thank you."
