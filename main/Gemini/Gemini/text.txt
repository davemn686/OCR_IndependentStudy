MODULE 1
9. Welcome to Spain
Spain is a southwestern European country located between France and Portugal. It borders the
North Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea, occupying roughly 85% of the Iberian
Peninsula. Each region/state of Spain has a unique cultural identity that residents are very
proud of. One finds that many of the things thought of as distinctively ‘Spanish’ often have a
local or regional origin. For example, the flamenco style of music and dance originated in
Andalucía (southern Spain). Despite the diversity of Spanish culture, the country also has a
strong and unifying national identity. The culture is famous for having a strong social
dimension, with many fiestas (celebrations) punctuating the year. Spaniards are renowned for
being proud people with a deep love of Spain and a strong awareness of their personal honor.
Their open and lively communication style often gives foreigners the impression that they are
confident and enthusiastic people.
Regionalism
Cultural differences are very noticeable between the regions of Spain. Spain contains several
different historical provinces and localities that each have their own distinct identity, cultural
practices, and traditions. For example, some regions have their own language, cuisine, and
literature that have developed through history.
National Identity and Language
The topic of national identity is a sensitive subject in Spain, as there are large points of
difference within the country. For example, an index measuring Europeans’ attachment to their
region, local area, and country found that Spain had the most internal variation in Europe. The
country is home to some of the most nationalistic regions (such as Madrid) where national
loyalty and pride are very strong. However, Spain also has some of the most regionalist
provinces in Europe (e.g., the Basque Country and Catalonia). In these places, loyalty, and
affiliation to one’s local identity is more important than the national identity for many people.
Language is deeply linked to identity in Spain as it is one of the most obvious indicators as to
which region people live in. Many Spaniards speak a local dialect at home or in daily life and
business. These are generally people who live in regions with very strong provincial identities,
such as Catalonia, the Basque Country, Galicia, Valencia, and the Balearic Islands.

Nonetheless, most Spaniards speak Spanish (Castilian), and almost all citizens who have a local
language are bilingual in Spanish to some degree. Some of the most widely spoken regional
languages are Catalan, Galician, and Basque. These all have a co-official status in the regions
they originated in.
Organization of the Day
One of the most obvious cultural differences between Spain and the English-speaking West is
the organization of the day. Spain has some of the longest working hours in Europe – from 9 am
to 8 pm with a two- or three-hour break in the afternoon (roughly 2 pm to 5 pm). This break is
traditionally for a siesta (nap). The custom of the siesta has developed a stereotype of Spaniards
as slow-paced, laid-back people. However, most Spaniards (58%) do not actually nap during
these hours. In some parts of Spain, such as rural towns, the streets may still fall quiet to allow
people to sleep indoors. However, many people do not have the ability to commute home for a
nap and choose to socialize at restaurants and bars instead.
Due to how late the working day finishes, there is a very big late-night culture in Spain.
Shopping centers and convenience stores are often open until 10 pm, meaning there is a
continual bustle in towns and cities later into the night. Meanwhile, most restaurants will only
open for dinner at about 9 pm. Dinner (la cena) is rarely eaten before this time, or usually even
later on weekends. Therefore, people normally go to bed around or after midnight, including
many children. Indeed, Spaniards have the latest bedtimes in Europe. There is currently a
national debate as to whether these working hours are still suited to modern Spanish life. With
fewer people actually sleeping during the hours of siesta, longer hours of work, and late
evenings, many Spaniards are sleep deprived. Nevertheless, the organization of the day and
late-night hours allow people to fit in time to see one another.
Socializing and Public Spaces
Spanish culture has a deep social dimension. It is considered normal for people to stay up late
talking with friends after a meal, sometimes into the early hours of the morning. Those people
who do not engage with this aspect of the culture may feel a slight social barrier with Spaniards,
as they often bond and build closer friendships over these late-night conversations. Colleagues
and friends also often meet during siesta hours and talk over a small beer (caña) to pass the
time.
Public spaces play a large role in Spaniards’ social life. Plazas (public squares) provide a place
for people to mingle without having to necessarily plan an occasion, and most towns and
3
suburbs of major cities generally have restaurants, cafes, and bars within walking distance.
These popular places provide Spaniards the opportunity to see the public, catch up with friends,
and hear the latest news. As most socialization tends to occur outside of people’s homes, people
can get to know many of the locals in their suburb or town, reinforcing a sense of community
belonging. For example, elderly people may be able to maintain a healthy social life simply by
sitting at cafes on popular streets, watching locals, and waiting to be spoken to by those passing
by.
Do’s and Don’ts
Do’s
Speak up when you have something to say. Spaniards generally expect that people will take the
initiative to interject when they feel they have something worthy to contribute to the
conversation. If you wait until there is a pause in the discussion for you to make your opinion
known, you are likely to be kept waiting a long time.
Try to tolerate a higher volume of noise. Spaniards are generally used to a higher level of noise
in social situations.
Don’ts
Do not imply that Spaniards are lazy, always late, or bad at their job. This stereotype can be
frustrating as the Spanish workforce is competitive and many people have to work very hard to
keep their jobs.
Do not criticize someone’s favorite football team unless you want to start a debate. Similarly,
don’t imply that football is a bad sport.
Communication
Verbal
Direct Communication: Spaniards generally have a direct communication style. They tend to
speak very openly and are comfortable showing emotion. This can give some foreigners from
more reserved cultures the impression that Spaniards are very confident people, leading them
to make decisions under this assumption when this may not necessarily be the case. You can
expect Spaniards to offer honest answers to sincere questions. They speak clearly about their
point and generally like to leave an interaction having voiced all their opinions. In return, they
4
expect similar honesty from their conversation partner and hence may fail to read into
understatements. It is important to avoid ambiguity and indirect speech.
Common Courtesy: Consider that ‘Please’ and ‘Thank you’ are not said as habitually in Spain.
This is not intended to be rude. Rather, some Spanish may find it a bit excessive to express
profuse gratitude and politeness throughout everyday exchanges.
Silence: Consider that Spaniards can struggle to stay quiet for long durations of time. They are
not particularly comfortable with silence in social situations. If the conversation does fall quiet,
it may be perceived to reflect badly on the relationship with the conversation partner.
Interruption & Volume: It is common and acceptable for friends to interrupt and talk over one
another as people get excited about the conversation. In some cases, people may shout to be
heard. This is not necessarily rude but indicates full engagement with the discussion. One often
hears Spaniards call out and even heckle during speaking engagements and performances. This
is expected to be taken in jest.
Swearing: Swearing is common and generally acceptable among friends.
Non-Verbal
Physical Contact: The Spanish tend to be quite tactile and expressive with physical touch.
Open displays of affection between couples are common and acceptable. It is common to see
people walking hand-in-hand, or friends walking together with their arms interlocked. Among
friends, people may nudge your arm, elbow, or leg to reinforce their points in conversations, put
an arm around your shoulder in camaraderie, or hold both your shoulders to show deep
appreciation. Some people may even casually finger the lapel of another person’s clothing or
neaten their attire for them. All these moments of physical interaction are meant to signify
friendly affection and approachability. Spanish men tend to be less guarded about physical
contact with other men than those from English-speaking countries.
Other Considerations
Consider that some Spaniards may have different levels of sensitivity regarding gender, race,
and ethnicity. People commonly describe one another by their physical attributes. It is normal
to call girls ‘beautiful princesses’ or refer to a convenience store as a ‘chino’ because an Asian
immigrant owns it.
Spaniards tend to call out to one another a lot. It is common for Spanish men to make
comments (piropos) on women’s beauty when they see them – for example, calling them
5
‘princess’ or ‘gorgeous’. This is not necessarily a sexual advance and is common across all ages.
For example, it is normal to see a man offer a very kind compliment about his grandmother’s
looks every time he sees her. Nevertheless, the acceptability of these comments varies
depending on the person.
